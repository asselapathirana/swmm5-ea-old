GUI based program to demonstrate the use of evolutionary algorithms to optimize drainage networks. It suppports drainage/sewerage networks modelled in [EPA-SWMM 5.0](http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/wswrd/wq/models/swmm/) system, based on "[SWMM5 package: Python bindings for EPA-SWMM5.0 engine](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/SWMM5/)".

## swmm5-ea ##
SWMM5 EA is a simple application to demonstrate how evolutionary algorithms can be used to solve optimization problems in the field of urban drainage. Typical problems it can solve include:

  * Find the optimal pipe/channel sizes for a drainage  network to handle a flow of a given magnitude.
  * Sizing of SuDS systems for the same purpose.
  * Cost-benefit optimization of interventions.
  * Model calibration
  * Staged design

### Installation ###
If you are just interested in using swmm5-ea program (e.g. to do some calculations, or to learn) on windows, look no further than SWMM5\_EA-x.y.z.k.exe file with the largest version number.
